# Loops, Conditionals, Objects, Events & Forms - Javascript

* JavaScript [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp) different kinds of Loops :

* for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
* for/in - loops through the properties of an object.
* while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
* do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

* [forEach](http://www.codequizzes.com/javascript-book/foreach-functions) Functions from CodeQuizzes.

* [Conditionals](https://www.javascript.com/learn/javascript/conditionals) control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run.

* [Switch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch) statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case.

* [Objects](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_constructors.asp) & Properties.  The "this" keyword, the thing called this is the object that "owns" the code. The value of this, when used in an object, is the object itself. In a constructor function this does not have a value.

* [Events]() To make web pages interactive or dynamic.  When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events. i.e. web page has finished loading, HTML input field was changed, button was clicked.
